**Project Description: Data Transformation with HDInsight and Databricks using ADF Orchestration**

This GitHub project provides a comprehensive guide for transforming data from two different sources, namely "testing.csv" and "population_by_age.tsv" files. The transformation process leverages the capabilities of two powerful platforms: HDInsight and Databricks. To streamline the workflow and automate the entire process, Azure Data Factory (ADF) is used as the orchestration tool to execute the HDInsight and Databricks Notebooks seamlessly.

**Project Goals:**

The primary objectives of this project are as follows:

1. Data Transformation: Extract, transform, and load (ETL) the data from the "testing.csv" and "population_by_age.tsv" files using HDInsight and Databricks, respectively.

2. Platform Comparison: Showcase the strengths and capabilities of HDInsight and Databricks in processing and handling big data scenarios, demonstrating which platform is better suited for specific tasks.

3. Seamless Orchestration: Utilize Azure Data Factory (ADF) as the central orchestration tool to schedule and execute the transformation tasks on both HDInsight and Databricks platforms.

**Project Contents:**

This GitHub repository contains the following essential components:

1. **Guide Documentation:** A detailed step-by-step guide outlining the entire data transformation process. This documentation will cover the setup, configuration, and execution of HDInsight and Databricks, as well as the orchestration using Azure Data Factory (ADF).

2. **Sample Data Files:** The "testing.csv" and "population_by_age.tsv" files are provided within the repository for users to replicate the data transformation process.

3. **HDInsight Scripts:** The necessary scripts and code snippets to execute the data transformation using HDInsight. This includes Spark jobs, data loading, and transformations specific to the "testing.csv" dataset.

4. **Databricks Notebooks:** Databricks notebooks with code examples for transforming the data from the "population_by_age.tsv" file. This will demonstrate the capabilities of Databricks for big data processing.

5. **ADF Pipelines:** Azure Data Factory pipeline definitions that facilitate the orchestration of HDInsight and Databricks tasks. These pipelines will enable the automatic execution of the transformation process.

**Usage:**

1. Clone or download the GitHub repository to your local environment.

2. Follow the step-by-step guide documentation provided in the repository to set up HDInsight and Databricks environments, configure ADF pipelines, and execute the data transformation process.

3. Use the sample data files "testing.csv" and "population_by_age.tsv" to replicate the data transformation on your chosen platforms.

**Contributions:**

This project is open to contributions from the community. If you find any issues, have suggestions for improvements, or want to add new features, feel free to submit pull requests.

Let's embark on this data transformation journey, leveraging the power of HDInsight and Databricks, and orchestrating the process with Azure Data Factory! Happy coding!
